This app was constructed to be able to read in a Car Registration plate number and return details about the car.
The app accesses Carcheck.ie and send the reg details in a GET method, it then parses through the returned HTML
and returns the Car details back to the user to be put into a box that can be shared to whatever app the user
wants to share it to in the format:

Input: 222d4:

Output:

BMW M4 CSL M4CL 2DR Auto, 2022
Body: 2 Door Coupe
CC: 2993
Fuel: Petrol
